## Incomplete/Simplified Features

  1. File Format Implementation:
    - The parser only handles JSON format, not binary .flare files
    - Comment: "For the initial implementation, we'll use a simplified format that's directly loaded as JSON, rather than parsing a binary format"
  2. Animation Engine Simplifications:
    - The animation engine only implements basic property tweening
    - Comment: "This is a simplified version that only handles basic property tweening"
    - Scene graph generation is simplified: "Create a simplified scene graph from the timeline data"
  3. WebAssembly Renderer Limitations:
    - Canvas resizing is not fully implemented: "Note: We'd typically resize the canvas here as well"
    - Unicode character handling is limited: "Character outside of BMP not supported in string encoding"
  4. Player Limitations:
    - Only handles JSON loading, not binary formats: "For now, we're expecting JSON directly // In a full implementation, we'd handle binary .flare files"
