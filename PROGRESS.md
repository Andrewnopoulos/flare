## Incomplete/Simplified Features

  1. File Format Implementation:
    - The parser only handles JSON format, not binary .flare files
    - Comment: "For the initial implementation, we'll use a simplified format that's directly loaded as JSON, rather than parsing a binary format"
  2. Animation Engine Simplifications:
    - The animation engine only implements basic property tweening
    - Comment: "This is a simplified version that only handles basic property tweening"
    - Scene graph generation is simplified: "Create a simplified scene graph from the timeline data"
  3. WebAssembly Renderer Limitations:
    - Canvas resizing is not fully implemented: "Note: We'd typically resize the canvas here as well"
    - Unicode character handling is limited: "Character outside of BMP not supported in string encoding"
  4. Player Limitations:
    - Only handles JSON loading, not binary formats: "For now, we're expecting JSON directly // In a full implementation, we'd handle binary .flare files"

## Phase 1 Development Plan

  1. Simple Timeline Animation

  The current implementation already has basic timeline animation with property tweening, but needs enhancements:

  1. Improve the AnimationEngine class:
    - Add support for more complex easing functions
    - Implement animation groups and sequences
    - Add support for path-based animation
    - Implement event triggers at specific frames
  2. Enhance animation playback controls:
    - Add looping options (once, repeat, ping-pong)
    - Implement playback rate control (slow motion, fast forward)
    - Add frame labels and ability to jump to labeled positions
  3. Optimize animation performance:
    - Implement object pooling to reduce garbage collection
    - Add support for animation instancing
    - Implement selective redrawing of changed areas

  2. Prototype Authoring Environment

  Create a minimal web-based authoring tool that allows:

  1. Basic timeline editor:
    - Layer management (add, delete, reorder layers)
    - Frame manipulation (add, delete, duplicate frames)
    - Keyframe creation and editing
    - Simple property inspector
  2. Canvas workspace:
    - Basic shape tools (rectangle, circle, path)
    - Selection and transformation tools
    - Property editor panel
    - Basic color selection
  3. Project management:
    - Save/load project files
    - Export to .flare format
    - Basic project settings
  4. Preview functionality:
    - Real-time preview window
    - Playback controls
    - Timeline scrubbing

  3. File Format Specification

  Formalize the file format introduced in the README:

  1. Complete the JSON schema:
    - Finalize the structure for timeline, layers, frames, elements
    - Define animation property formats
    - Document script binding format
  2. Implement ZIP-based .flare format:
    - Create proper package structure (manifest.json, timeline.json, assets/ etc.)
    - Add asset management and references
    - Implement asset optimization during export
  3. Develop import/export functionality:
    - Complete the FlareParser class to handle both JSON and binary formats
    - Add validation to ensure file integrity
    - Implement proper error handling for malformed files
  4. Documentation:
    - Create comprehensive format specification document
    - Provide examples for common use cases
    - Document extension points for future format enhancements

  Implementation Priority

  1. First milestone: Complete the timeline animation enhancements
  2. Second milestone: Develop the .flare file format specification and implementation
  3. Third milestone: Create the prototype authoring environment
